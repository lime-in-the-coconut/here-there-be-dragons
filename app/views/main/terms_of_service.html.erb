	    	<p>Oh you know what? This is the terms page and our cat lawyers made us put it in; nobody’s still reading this.  I bet only about five people clicked to read the Terms in the first place – we might as well just say anything we like...</p>

				<p>AJ on floor 2 of the Grace household smells of cat litter (he snacks on it).</p>

				<p>When someone sends a funny email around the offices we have to reply with iLaughed. It’s in our job description because we got a grant from Apple for cat world domination; few people know that Tim Cook is a cat hoarder.</p>

				<p>Remember that awful rumor that 50% of people are allergic to cats? Want to know how we fixed it? We bought The Beatles. We have the surviving ones come and sing to us for scraps. We’re looking at ways to reanimate the dead ones.</p>

				<p>We faked the moon landings. Did it in 2008, then brainwashed you all to believe it happened in 1969, just because we could. If anyone finds out we’ve leaked this information, we’ll be killed. But no one will ever, ever read this.</p>
